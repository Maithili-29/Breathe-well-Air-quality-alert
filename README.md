# Breathe-Well: Air Quality Alert

## Project Description
**Breathe-Well** is a student-developed app that monitors air quality in real-time and provides alerts when pollution levels rise. The app fetches data from public AQI APIs, analyzes local air quality, and notifies users with tips to reduce exposure. The goal is to help users make informed decisions about outdoor activities and health.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time AQI monitoring based on user location
- Color-coded air quality levels: Green (Good), Yellow (Moderate), Red (Unhealthy)
- Alerts for high pollution levels
- Tips to improve indoor air quality
- Historical AQI data stored locally
